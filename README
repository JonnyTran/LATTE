This code is provided to reproduce experiments in the paper "Layer-stacked Attention for Heterogeneous Network Embedding".
Running this code requires installation of Python 3.X packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them by running:
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

It also requires installation of the COGDL Toolkit from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl
To install it, go to a parent directory and run:
>>> git clone https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl
>>> cd cogdl
>>> pip install -e .

To perform either transductive or inductive experiment runs for a method on a dataset, go to the `LATTE` repository and
run the command:
>>> python run.py --method [MetaPath2Vec, HAN, GTN, LATTE-1, LATTE-2, LATTE-2 proximity] --dataset [ACM, DBLP, IMDB] --inductive [True, False] --num_gpus [0, 1]
The wandb logger will generate a link for you inspect the performance metrics as it trains.

The models' hyperparameters have been kept as described in the paper. If you'd like to inspect LATTE's algorithm & code,
open the `conv.py` file and the `LATTENodeClassifier` class in the `methods.py` file.

Happy Reviewing!
